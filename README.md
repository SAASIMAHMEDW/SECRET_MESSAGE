## NOTE: 
Its not a proper encryption and decryption thing. its somewhere encryption and decryption. read below for better understanding.

**This program is used for encrypting and decrypting the given word.**

*GIVE ME A WORD*
_____________________________
### ENCRIPTION
1. if the given character length is greater than 3.
2. Then it simply take the first char and apppend it at the ending of the given word. 
4. after that program add three random character at the beginning and three random char at the ending.
5. and now your encrypted word is ready!!! horrrrrray
6. #########################
7. if the given word length is less than 3.
8. then this program just simply reverse the string.
_____________________________
### EXAMPLE ENCRYPTION
1. consider the example word: **oracle**
2. In above example the length of the word is greater than 3 so it takes the first char from the word and append it at the end (in this case **o**) now word would become like this **racleo**
3. after that add three random char at the beginning and ending. begWord=**hgs**
            endWord=**ksd**
   now the word would become like this
   **hgsracleoksd**
 *YOUR ENCRYPTED WORD*

1. len of the word is less than 3 example **of**
2. just reverse it
    **fo**
   *YOUR ENCRYPTED WORD*
______________________________
## DECRYPTION
1. if if the len of the word is greater than 3 ...so In description part the program take the descripting word.
2. and remove the frist three char and last three char.
3. after that pick the last char and append it at the Beginning.
4. your decripted word is ready.
5. #########################
6. if the decripting word len is less than 3 then this program just reverse the string.
______________________________
## EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION
*consider above encrypted word* **hgsracleoksd**
1. take the word and remove first three letter and last three leterr from the word.
   **racleo**
3. now take the last word and append it at the beginning.
   **oracle**

1. if you ==description== word is less than 3 then just reverse it.
2. consider above 2 word encrypted word
   **fo**
   just reverse it
   **of**

# About me
 hi guys, this is **AHMED** i am 20 year old and i made this program as an exercise. i am still learning python so it may not so good but for me it is amazing. and i learnt so many things while making this small project or exercise how to manipulate the string and all. it was nice experience while making this project.
